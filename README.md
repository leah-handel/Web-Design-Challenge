# Website for Latitude vs. Weather

## General Info

This project is a website on github pages that showcases the data and figures from a previous project comparing various weather conditions at different latitudes. 

The data was originally pulled from the OpenWeather API. I have a version of the earlier project in my python-api-challenge repo, however, this version of the data is not mine. It was pulled from OpenWeather on two different days - 1/5/17 for the figures, and 6/13/18 for the table (which is why it's not the same data!). 

This project was completed for week 11 homework for the Northwestern Data Science and Visualization Bootcamp.
