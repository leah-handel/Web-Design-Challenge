## General Info

This project is a website on github pages that showcases the data and figures from a previous project comparing various weather conditions at different latitudes. 

This project was completed for week 11 homework for the Northwestern Data Science and Visualization Bootcamp.

## Data Sources

The data was originally pulled from [the OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). My version of the analysis and visualizations are in my [latitude vs. weather conditions repo](https://github.com/leah-handel/Latitude-vs.-Weather-Conditions), however, the data displayed here is not mine. It was pulled from OpenWeather on two different days - 1/5/17 for the figures, and 6/13/18 for the table.
